# working-with-data2

This project analyzes orders placed by US customers on a grocery delivery application to uncover patterns and trends in customer purchases to suggest better business strategies using time series data in Python. The following Kaggle datasets are used: [Different Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kzmontage/sales-from-different-stores) and [US Population By State](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrepetit881234/us-population-by-state).

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

The main steps of the project are outlined below:

- **Part 1** : Data cleaning, preprocessing and creation of synthetic data with similar distribution, both datasets are merged to a single dataset
- **Part 2** : Exploratory Data Analysis, using histograms and boxplots in matplotlib, outliers inspection and removal, correlation matrix of quantitative features, time series specific graphs exploring the evolution of orders over time and order patterns by different groupings (age group, revenue level, gender, etc...) 
- **Part 3** : Focus on specific subsets to uncover insights
